## Overview
This project is a simple Unity-based 2D game where the player can interact with an enemy that patrols a platform. The enemy uses animations to walk and attack the player, with the ability to be hurt. The project demonstrates basic AI behaviors for a patrol enemy.

## Features
- **Patrolling AI**: The enemy moves back and forth along a designated path.
- **Attack Animations**: The enemy has two attack animations (`EnemyPatrol Attack 1` and `EnemyPatrol Attack 2`).
- **Damage Handling**: The enemy has a hurt animation triggered when hit.
- **Basic Physics**: The enemy uses a `RigidBody2D` for movement physics and `BoxCollider2D` for collision detection.

## Requirements
- Unity 2020.3 or higher
- Basic understanding of Unity's Animator system and physics components
